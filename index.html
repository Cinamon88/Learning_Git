                    There are days
                    I wake up and I pinch myself
                    You're with me, not someone else
                    And I'm scared, yeah, I'm still scared
                    That it's all a dream<br><br>
                    'Cause you still look perfect as days go by
                    Even the worst ones, you make me smile
                    I'd stop the world if it gave us time<br><br>
                    'Cause when you love someone
                    You open up your heart
                    When you love someone
                    You make room
                    If you love someone
                    And you're not afraid to lose 'em
                    You probably never loved someone like I do
                    You probably never loved someone like I do<br><br>
                    When you say
                    You love the way I make you feel
                    Everything becomes so real
                    Don't be scared, no, don't be scared
                    'Cause you're all I need<br><br>
                    And you still look perfect as days go by
                    Even the worst ones, you make me smile
                    I'd stop the world if it gave us time<br><br>
                    'Cause when you love someone
                    You open up your heart
                    When you love someone
                    You make room
                    If you love someone
                    And you're not afraid to lose 'em
                    You probably never loved someone like I do
                    You probably never loved someone like I do<br><br>
